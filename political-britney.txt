Anacondas make their home in the Amazon jungles of South America and are part of the Boa Constrictor family.  Anacondas live near rivers, lakes and swamps and like to live alone.  Water is their main escape method when confronted with danger. Rather than attacking they will choose to slide into the water unnoticed, if possible.
Anacondas eat amphibious animals, like frogs & toads, as well as fish, caiman, birds, ducks and turtles.
The average size of one of these snake-giants is 6,1 meters long and 148.5 kg. 
Anacondas give birth to live young, around 24-35 at a time.
Anacondas are very difficult for scientists to study or even find.  They are really quiet and leave no trail.  They spend a lot of their time in the dark waters of their habitat
Baby got back!
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at, look at, look at
Anacondas grow constantly their entire life.
They are usually dark green in color, have 2 rows of black spots on their back and white marks on the sides.
Anaconda hunts on the ground and in the water, but it spends most of its life in the water where it moves more easily.
When it is in the water, whole body, except nostrils (which are located on the top of its head), is submerged.
Anaconda can stay under water for 10 minutes before it comes to the surface to grab some air.
They like to eat fish, turtles, caimans, capybaras, pigs, jaguars, deer…
When they hunt smaller meal, they eat up to 40 pounds of food per day.
Large meal will keep snake satiated few weeks and it will not eat during that time.
Anaconda is not a venomous snake. It uses strong and muscular body to kill its prey. Like other constrictors, anaconda will grab its victim, wrap its body around the prey and squeeze it until it dies from suffocation.
When animal dies, anaconda swallows whole prey in one piece.
Anaconda is nocturnal animal, which means that it hunts during the night.
April and may are reserved for mating. Six months later, female anaconda gives birth to 20-40 young anacondas.
Babies are 2 feet long and they are capable for individual life from the moment they are born.
Anacondas live 10-12 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity.
 The Anaconda uses its rows of needle like teeth to anchor itself to the prey’s flesh. Once in its grip it goes in for the kill, wrapping coils of powerful muscle around the prey. The coils constrict, stopping the animal breathing, even crushing vital organs. 
The anaconda’s huge bulk allows it to take down prey the size of a small horse; like tapir and the world’s biggest rodent the capybara. 
Anaconda can grow up to eight metres in length, over 130 kilos of pure predatory muscle. 
Anaconda can kill and eat one and a half to two meters long Caiman. 
Anaconda lies at the water’s edge waiting for animals to come down for a drink. A surprise attack allows them to subdue huge prey such as the tapir and deer. When they’ve made the kill, the anaconda unlocks their jaw bones. Walking them down the victim’s body to swallow the huge prey whole.

Snakes consume a variety of items including termites, rodents, birds, frogs, small deer and other reptiles. Snakes eat their prey whole and are able to consume prey three times larger than the diameter of their head because their lower jaw can separate from the upper jaw. To keep prey from escaping, snakes have rear-facing teeth that hold their prey in their mouths.
Venomous snakes inject their prey with venom, while constrictors squeeze their prey. They do not need to hunt everyday. Anacondas and pythons can survive for up to a year without food after feeding. Snakes hunt mostly at night.
A recently discovered fossil snake was 49 feet long, longer than a school bus!
Snakes are found throughout the world except Antarctica, Iceland, Ireland, Greenland and New Zealand. Most snakes are found in tropical regions. Snakes are found in many habitats including in the water, forests, deserts and prairies.
Often observed flicking its tongue, snakes use their forked tongue to smell the air. Snakes are ectotherms, meaning they must regulate their body temperature externally by sunning themselves or retreating to cool, shaded areas. Snakes hibernate during the winter. Snakes must shed their skin three to six times per year.
Most snake species lay eggs, but some species give birth to live young. Snakes lay their eggs in a warm location. With the exception of some python species, eggs and young are not cared for by the male or female.
Anaconda Anacondas are the largest and heaviest known snakes. They can be found in tropical rainforests, lakes and swamps of South America. Anacondas are especially numerous near Amazon and Orinoco rivers. There are 4 types of anacondas. Although they are large in size, scientists can't find them easily because they hide in the water. People hunt anacondas because of their skin which is highly appreciated in the fashion industry. Luckily, they are not endangered.
Anaconda can be 30 feet long (like a school bus) and weigh up to 550 pounds (like 11 kids). Females are larger than males.\
